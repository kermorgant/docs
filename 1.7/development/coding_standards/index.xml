      <description>Commits &amp;amp; Pull Requests conventions Commits In the past, we used to have only one commit by pull request. This was a bad habit. We now require contributors to make atomic commits, so you will surely have more than one commit in a single pull request. This will be helpful to review, cherry-pick or revert (we hope to never have to do that ðŸ˜‰) the changes.
What&amp;rsquo;s an atomic commit?</description>
